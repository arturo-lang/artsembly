### What does this package do?

This package features a bytecode "assembler" for the Arturo programming language. In a few words, it allows to write bytecode for the Arturo VM directly, only in a friendly, Assembly-style fashion.

> [!WARNING]
> This package is to be considered mostly an - adventurous - experiment, highlighting what is possible and is not meant to be neither a replacement of Arturo nor a 100% functional bytecode assembler that aims to cover everything!

### How do I use it?

All you have to do is `import` it and then pass a block (or text) of valid ArtSembly code. The returned value is always a Bytecode object, which means that you can either run it directly (via [`do`](https://arturo-lang.io/documentation/library/core/do/)) or manipulate it further, if you wish.

#### Example 

```arturo
import "artsembly"!

do assemble {
    push 0                 ; x: 0
    store 'x

    theLoop:
        load 'x            ; print x
        call 'print

        load 'x
        push 1
        call 'add
        store 'x           ; x: 1 + x

        load 'x
        push 5
        call 'equal?       ; x = 5

        jmpIf 'finished    ; if x = 10 -> go to finished

        goto 'theLoop      ; else -> go back up

    finished:
        push "finished!"
        call 'print        ; print "finished!"
}
```

**Output:**

```bash
0
1
2
3
4
finished!
```
